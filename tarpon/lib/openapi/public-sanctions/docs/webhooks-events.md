# Webhook events

Flagright uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events. A wehbook event is fired when a monitored search has been detected as having updated search results available, and/or the suspended state of the monitored search changes.

A webhook enables Flagright to push real-time notifications to your app. Flagright uses HTTPS to send these notifications to your app as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your backend systems.

## Steps to receive webhooks

- Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
- Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your server.
- Handle requests from Flagright by parsing each event object and returning 2xx response status codes.
- Deploy your webhook endpoint so itâ€™s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
- Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL in the Flagright console and store the secret signing key (for verifying the payload) in a secure place.

# Sonar FAQ

## Is it free?

Yes, Sonar is free. We ask that everyone in the community contributes by reporting the bad actors in their environment. Flagright reserves the right to terminate access if we detect a case of abuse or ill intent.

## Is it real time?

Responses are designed to be delivered near real-time but Flagright does not provide any guarantees or SLAs for real-time response on free tier.

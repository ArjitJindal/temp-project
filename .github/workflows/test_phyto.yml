  # If we have more than one job in the future and we require all jobs to pass before we can
  # merge a PR. Consider to use https://github.com/marketplace/actions/alls-green (related to: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26733).
  # Otherwise we'll need to manually add any new jobs to be required for the branch protection settings in the GitHub repo.

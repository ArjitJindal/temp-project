## Flagright back office console

This project is initialized with Ant Design.

## Prepare Environment

Install `node_modules`:

```bash
yarn
```

### Clean up caches

When switching between branches, the local `umi` caches can wreck the build. In order to clean the cache, run:

```bash
yarn clean-cache
```

## Provided Scripts

Ant Design provides some useful script to help you quick start and build with web project, code style check and test.

Scripts provided in `package.json`. It's safe to modify or add additional script:

Assuming you have nvm and yarn installed:

1. yarn
2. nvm use 12
3. yarn start

# tarpon

![tarpons](https://github.com/flagright/tarpon/blob/main/tarpons.png)

Codenamed after the [majestic tarpons](https://youtu.be/wV2CF2WWGFQ).

## Project Structure

- src - Code for lambda functions
  - Rules Engine
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- lib/cdk-tarpon-stack.ts - The CDK configuration of the application's AWS resources.

## Prerequisites

- SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- CDK CLI - [Install the CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html)
- Node.js (v14) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Test locally

```bash
sam local start-api -t cdk.out/tarpon.template.json
sam local invoke "VerifyTransactionFunction" --event events/event.json -t cdk.out/tarpon.template.json
```

## Deploy

```bash
cdk deploy
```

## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
tarpon$ sam logs -n RulesEngineFunction --stack-name tarpon --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name tarpon
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)

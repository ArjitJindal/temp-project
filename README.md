# tarpon

![tarpons](https://github.com/flagright/tarpon/blob/main/tarpons.png)

Codenamed after the [majestic tarpons](https://youtu.be/wV2CF2WWGFQ).

## Project Structure

- src - Code for lambda functions
  - Rules Engine
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- lib/cdk-tarpon-stack.ts - The CDK configuration of the application's AWS resources.

## Prerequisites

- SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- CDK CLI - [Install the CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html)
- Node.js (v14) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing Functions Locally

You can test functions locally, ensure you've your SSO configured (including default region - `region` field in `~/.aws/config`) before running.

You will also need to add a `default` profile in `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[default]
region=us-east-2
aws_access_key_id=false
aws_secret_access_key=false

```

### For first run

Ensure you have the local instance of DynamoDB running. You need Docker installed and runnable for this. Run this command (with sudo if you're on Linux):

```
npm run start-local-ddb
```

For the first run create the database using:

```
npm run create-local-ddb
```

Run the below command to recreate the table:

```
npm run recreate-local-ddb
```

You can now run the following:

```
npm run create-user
npm run get-user
npm run create-rule-instance
npm run update-rule-instance
npm run verify-transaction
npm run get-transaction
npm run import-list
```

For console, you will also need mongoDB. You can start a local containerized instance using"

```
npm run start-local-mongodb
```

Then you can synthesize local cdk template like so:

```
npm run synth:local
```

Finally, you can start local api:

```
npm run start-local-api
```

Local environment config (ex: tenantID) is stored in `local-dev.ts`.

### Generating Data for Local:

Run the script once you got DynamoDB and mongo running

`generate-local-data`

## Deploy

In order to deploy to a new account (or the first time you're deploying), you have to run `cdk bootstrap` like so:

```
cdk bootstrap --profile <profileName>
```

Then you can deploy to dev like so:

```bash
npm run deploy:dev
```

To deploy to your stack for dev:

```bash
GITHUB_USER=<username> npm run deploy:dev:user:clean
```

### Fixing common deploy errors by clean deploy

You can run `npm run deploy:dev:clean` to cleanup stuff and create a deployment afresh.

## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
tarpon$ sam logs -n RulesEngineFunction --stack-name tarpon --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name tarpon
```

## Data Migration

### Creata a new migration script

Create a new migration script to be run before deployment

```bash
npm run migration:pre:create --name=<migration_name>
```

A new migration file will be created in `scripts/migrations/pre-deployment`

Create a new migration script to be run after deployment

```bash
npm run migration:post:create --name=<migration_name>
```

A new migration file will be created in `scripts/migrations/post-deployment`

### Run migrations locally

```bash
ENV=local npm run migration:pre:up
ENV=local npm run migration:post:up
```

### Run migrations in Dev/Sandbox/Prod manually

1. Refresh aws credentials

```
npm run aws-sso-login:dev
```

2. Copy and paste the credentials printed from the previous step to the terminal

```bash
AWS Credentials:
====================================
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
====================================
```

3. Run the migration with env vars `ENV`, `AWS_REGION`, `SM_SECRET_ARN` being set

```bash
ENV=dev AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 SM_SECRET_ARN='arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-central-1:911899431626:secret:mongoAtlasCreds-RvzMVI' npm run migration:pre:up
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)

### Creating and uploading test data

**Uploading to local DynamoDB**

In the dynamodb document client initialization, add endpoint: `localhost:8000` like so:

```
  /* DB init */
  const dynamoDb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({
    credentials: new AWS.SharedIniFileCredentials({
      profile: 'AWSAdministratorAccess-911899431626',
      endpoint: 'localhost:8000'
    }),
  })
```

ALWAYS TEST LOCALLY BEFORE INSERTING INTO DDB TABLE IN AWS

**Uploading to DynamoDB dev account table**

Ensure the latest credentials (`access_key_id`, `secret_access_key` and `session_token`) are present in `~/.aws/credentials`

- If you don't have the credentials, you can get them using [get-role-credentials](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sso/get-role-credentials.html) CLI command:
  ```
    get-role-credentials
  --role-name <value (ex: PowerUserAccess)>
  --account-id <value>
  --access-token <value>
  ```
  The access token can be found in `~/.aws/cache` in a JSON that store the temp creds - more details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/sso-temporary-credentials/)

Once credentials are legit, you can run:

```
npm run create-and-upload-test-data
```

### Create a New Tenant

For now, we can use the script `onboard-tarpon-api.sh` to create a new tenant, its usage plan and API key, and it'll create a fixed set of rules if they're not yet created. After this script is run, we need to manually activate the rules for the tenant in the FDT console.

Dev env:

```bash
bash src/scripts/onboard-tarpon-api.sh --tenantName sh-payment --tenantWebsite https://sh-payments.com/ --env dev
```

Sandbox env:

```bash
bash src/scripts/onboard-tarpon-api.sh --tenantName sh-payment --tenantWebsite https://sh-payments.com/ --env sandbox
```

Prod env (need to specify region):

```bash
bash src/scripts/onboard-tarpon-api.sh --tenantName sh-payment --tenantWebsite https://sh-payments.com/ --env prod-asia-1
```

### Creating a new rule

- Create a new function in `rules` folder
- Create a unit test for the rule that covers all cases in `__test__` folder
- Add it to requisite rule list (currently `transaction` or `user` rule types)
- Merge PR and deploy to all environments (Dev, Sandbox and prod regions)
- Launch the rule on console - [Instructions](https://www.notion.so/flagright/Launching-new-Rule-on-Console-51803611658047d79a5a3757fcc8b755)
